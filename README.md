# Dot Map Plus

This repository documents my efforts to improve upon dot maps.

Dot maps, perhaps more than any other visualization, emphasize that there are real people behind datasets. Dots can be color coded, size adjusted, and shape adjusted to communicate a range of variable. Despite attractive flexibility, they also present several interpretation challenges.

1. Dots can stack or overlap, making density and shape difficult to perceive beyond a certain point.
2. Because stock visualization software frequently draw dots in order of factored categories, the later factor levels are more prominent than earlier levels leading to misinterpretation.
3. It's difficult for humans to comprehend how many dots are being viewed as the number increases.
4. It's difficult for humans to compare the relative share of dots belonging to categories.
5. Color blindness add interpretation difficulties.


## Conceptualizing Variables to Communicate

Rundown of 

### Simple Counts

The most basic dot map will have one dot for each unit of some dataset.

One dot could equal:

* One person
* One household
* One city
* One business
* One event

### Demographic Variables

Demographic variables are things like age, race/ethnicity, marital status, and household size.

* Dot color could encode race and ethnicity
* Dot shape could encode marital status
* Dot size could encode household size

### Economic Variables

* Dot size could encode income
* Dot color could encode where a worker lives
